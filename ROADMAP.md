## Mid Term (3-6 Months)

- [ ] **Image Gallery Implementation:** Showcase farm products and activities. Rationale: Visually engage users and highlight product offerings. Scope: Image upload, display, and basic gallery management. Success: High user engagement with the image gallery. Risks: Image storage costs, potential for low-quality image uploads.
- [ ] **Blog/News Section:** Share farm updates, recipes, and agricultural insights. Rationale: Improve SEO, build community, and provide valuable content. Scope: Content Management System (CMS) integration (TODO: CHOOSE CMS or headless CMS), blog post creation and display. Success: Regular blog updates, increased website traffic, and social media engagement. Risks: Lack of content creation resources.
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement necessary improvements. Rationale: Ensure inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards. Scope: WCAG compliance review, code adjustments, and user testing. Success: Improved accessibility score, positive feedback from users with disabilities. Risks: Significant code refactoring required.

## Long Term (6-12 Months)

- [ ] **E-commerce Integration (Phase 1):** Allow direct purchase of farm products online. Rationale: Increase revenue and expand market reach. Scope: Shopping cart, product catalog, payment gateway integration (TODO: CHOOSE PAYMENT GATEWAY), basic order management. Success: Successful online sales and order fulfillment. Risks: Payment processing fees, security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Subscription Service:** Offer recurring deliveries of farm products. Rationale: Generate recurring revenue and build customer loyalty. Scope: Subscription management system, recurring payment processing, delivery scheduling. Success: High subscription signup rate and customer retention. Risks: Complex logistics and inventory management.
- [ ] **Interactive Map:** Display farm location, points of interest, and product availability. Rationale: Enhance user engagement and provide valuable information. Scope: Map integration (e.g., Google Maps API), custom markers, and data integration. Success: Increased user interaction with the map and improved navigation. Risks: Map API costs, data accuracy.

- [ ] **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit and implement necessary improvements. Rationale: Ensure inclusivity and compliance with accessibility standards. Scope: WCAG compliance review, code adjustments, and user testing. Success: Improved accessibility score, positive feedback from users with disabilities. Risks: Significant code refactoring required.

## Long Term (6-12 Months)

- [ ] **E-commerce Integration (Phase 1):** Allow direct purchase of farm products online. Rationale: Increase revenue and expand market reach. Scope: Shopping cart, product catalog, payment gateway integration (TODO: CHOOSE PAYMENT GATEWAY), basic order management. Success: Successful online sales and order fulfillment. Risks: Payment processing fees, security vulnerabilities.

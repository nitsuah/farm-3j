# IDEAS

## Home page

- header - cornfield background thats grows and then "ages" a bit and animates with wind then a tractor comes and runs it over to "harvest". change the top of background to a gradient with clouds barely poking through
- header title - add a "Farm" emoji as the icon for now placeholder. change Farm 3j to "Pretty Good Farm" or "PG Farm"?
- MIDDLE CARDS - make slightly bigger to accomodate new backgrounds/animations.
- the fresh produce section - have a little animated farm scene in the background with crops growing and maybe an insect or two flying or walking around.
- local community - maybe just an "iso"/tilt-shift of a small town. no movement for now.
- sustainable farming - a small animated scene showing solar panels, wind turbines, and and a happy pig rolling in mud.
- Move "Contact us" and Get in Touch to the About page. the get in touch form should also be a modal that only appears if the "contact us" is clicked. The background should dim and the modal should have a small farm scene in the background with maybe a scarecrow and some crows flying around.
- the entire site should only be a "fullscreen" app. so no scrolling at all unless its nested divs/containers/cards within the primary app. everything fits in one screen and if you want to see more you click links to go to other "pages" that also fit in one screen. so we should see the header and footer at all times too.
